  <h1> Hi, I'm Bianca 👋</h1>

  I work with enterprise systems, GenAI agents, and user enablement.
  
  ### About this GitHub
  
  This GitHub started as a learning space during my academic projects,
  where I explored front-end, back-end fundamentals, and UI/UX concepts
  through coursework and personal experiments.
  
  These projects reflect my foundations in:
  - Web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
  - Basic programming logic and system thinking
  - UI/UX and mockup creation
  - Understanding how users interact with technology
  
  ### Current focus
  
  Today, my professional focus has evolved.
  
  I work with ERP systems, configuration, and process optimization,
  and I contribute to internal initiatives focused on GenAI agents
  for Helpdesk teams, aiming to reduce repetitive tasks, minimize errors,
  and improve consistency through structured prompts and low-code workflows.
  
  This GitHub is gradually evolving to include:
  - Prompt design and iteration for GenAI agents
  - Agent logic and behavior documentation
  - Low-code experiments related to AI enablement
  - Documentation patterns for AI adoption in enterprise environments
  
  I am not a software developer.
  I understand programming fundamentals, but my focus is on
  prompt engineering, system logic, and making AI usable for real people. </div>
